**Project Description:** A log report manager is a java application that filtes and sorts log reports depending on various factors and displays it to the user's screen.

**Learning Outcome**<br />
•	Implemented a Java application that produces reports of user activity logs displaying filtered by and specific date and hour by day and most frequent activities
<br />
•	Improved my ability in selection of appropriate sorting algorithm and data structure for better run time for instance learning that Linear Probing Hash Map has a better run time than Unordered Linked Map with transpose heuristics
