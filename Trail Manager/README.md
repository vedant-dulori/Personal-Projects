**JAVA PROJECT** <br />
<br />
<br />
**Project Name:** Trail Manager<br />
**Project Description:**  An offline Java trail manager to solve the problem of determine the least costly set of trails necessary to connect all of the attractions in and around the greenspace by using Kruskal’s shorted path algorithm
<br /><br />
**Learning Outcome**<br />
•	Discovered and analysed that Prim’s algorithm along with heap based priority queues would have helped maintain runtime of O(log n) compared to using adjacency map data structure with runtime of O(n log n)
